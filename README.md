Installed Necessary Packages: Installed the imagededup package, which is essential for image deduplication using various hashing methods and CNNs.

Imported Required Libraries: Imported CNN from imagededup.methods, along with utility functions and libraries like pandas and matplotlib for data handling and visualization.

Algorithm Initialization: Initialized the CNN algorithm using cnn = CNN(), preparing the model for encoding images.

Defined Image Directory: Specified the directory containing images to be analyzed for duplicates, ensuring the model knows where to find the data.

Encoded Images: Used the initialized CNN algorithm to encode images, leveraging the Global Average Pooling layer of a pretrained MobileNet model to generate unique encodings for each image.
